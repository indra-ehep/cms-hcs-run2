# To Do
## Update the Makefile
#### RecoNtuple_Skim/Makefile
Currently, the full paths of headers and src files are specified separtly. Better to include them by defining variables and pattern in the Makefile.


## Update the skim sample fetching script
#### RecoNtuple_Skim/sample/produceFileLists.py
The script is double counting the paths of a few samples. Need to parse a better string to the wildcard option
